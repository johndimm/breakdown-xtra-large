Breakdown is a tool to slice and dice financial data that you download from your Mint account.  In a few clicks, it can answer questions like:

Where did all my money go?
When did we start shopping more at Trader Joe's than Vons?
Why did we spend more on vacation this year than usual?
How have our favorite restaurants changed over the months and years?

Breakdown works by loading your Mint data into Lovefield, the browser-based local database written in javascript by a team at Google.

Your data stays on your machine.
